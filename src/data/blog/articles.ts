<h3>The Identity Shift</h3>

<p>The most important decision in CGraph's history was <strong>Phase 26: The Great Delete</strong>. We ripped out every gamification UI element — XP bars, level badges, leaderboards, quests, battle pass, prestige, skill trees, seasonal events, and the shop. The backend achievement and cosmetics systems were intentionally preserved.</p>

<p>What replaced it: <strong>Cosmetics & Self-Expression</strong> (325 items across 7 categories), <strong>Pulse Reputation</strong> (organic trust signals), <strong>Nodes Currency</strong> (creator economy), and <strong>Discovery</strong> (finding communities and content).</p>

<h3>Platform Architecture</h3>

<p>CGraph runs on a dual-app architecture: a marketing landing page at <code>cgraph.org</code> and the authenticated app at <code>app.cgraph.org</code>. The backend is Elixir/Phoenix 1.8 deployed on Fly.io with a hierarchical supervision tree, 7 circuit breakers, and multi-tier caching (ETS → Cachex → Redis → PostgreSQL).</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Post-quantum E2EE with <strong>PQXDH (ML-KEM-768 + P-256)</strong> and <strong>Triple Ratchet</strong> protocol. AES-256-GCM for message encryption. Guardian JWT with JTI revocation, HTTP-only cookies, fail-closed token blacklist. 7 circuit breakers protect every external dependency.</p>

<h3>What Ships in v1.0</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong>: DMs, group conversations, threads, reactions, read receipts, typing indicators</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong>: Boards, threads, nested comments, voting, cursor-based pagination</li>
<li><strong>Communities</strong>: Servers with channels, roles, permissions, invites</li>
<li><strong>Voice/Video</strong>: WebRTC peer connections with ICE/TURN, call history persistence</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetics</strong>: 325 items (badges, titles, nameplates, themes, name styles, frames, forum themes)</li>
<li><strong>Creator Economy</strong>: Nodes currency, paid DMs, premium threads, tipping, revenue sharing</li>
<li><strong>Secret Chat</strong>: Disappearing messages, screenshot detection, forward-restricted messages</li>
<li><strong>Administration</strong>: Audit logging, moderation tooling, and operational dashboards</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>: React Native + Expo 54 with full feature parity, offline-first (WatermelonDB)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's Next</h3>

<p>Phase 19 (production credentials) is the only remaining blocker for public launch. After that: public beta, Stripe live billing, Apple/Google store submissions, and MeiliSearch production deployment. The codebase is ready — 8.7/10 architecture score, zero compile warnings, zero Credo issues, and comprehensive test coverage across all 4 apps.</p>

<p>Historical note: Phase 39 explored an enterprise/compliance track. That track was archived in Phase 44. The audit logging improvements discussed here remained part of the active product, but the SSO/compliance/organization-management surface did not.</p>

<h3>SSO & SAML Authentication</h3>

<p>This phase originally introduced <strong>SAML 2.0</strong> and enterprise identity-management work alongside the existing OAuth providers (Google, Apple, Facebook). Those enterprise-specific flows were later archived, so this section is kept as historical context rather than active product guidance.</p>

<p>The implementation follows the standard SAML flow: SP-initiated login → IdP authentication → assertion validation → session creation. Combined with our existing Guardian JWT system, refresh tokens, and HTTP-only cookies.</p>

<h3>Audit Logging</h3>

<p>Every sensitive operation is now tracked with actor, action, target, and timestamp. The <code>CGraph.Audit</code> GenServer buffers events in memory and flushes to the database via <code>CGraph.Accounts.AuditLog</code>. On shutdown, <code>terminate/2</code> ensures no events are lost.</p>

<p>Audit categories: authentication events, admin actions, compliance operations, data access, and security incidents. Retention policies automatically clean up old entries by category.</p>

<h3>Compliance Tooling</h3>

<p>GDPR data export, right to erasure, and data portability are handled through the existing <code>DataExportWorker</code> Oban job. The dedicated compliance-suite UI discussed during this phase was later archived, while core audit/data-export capabilities remained active.</p>

<h3>Admin Dashboard Expansion</h3>

<p>Four dashboard panels (DashboardOverview, UsersManagement, EventsManagement, MarketplaceModeration) moved to real API calls instead of placeholder data. Core administrator access via the <code>RequireAdmin</code> plug remained in the active app after the enterprise-specific track was archived.</p>

    content: `
<p>Phase 36 introduced the creator economy — a system where content creators earn real value from their contributions. The foundation: <strong>Nodes</strong>, CGraph's platform currency that powers paid interactions, tipping, and revenue sharing.</p>

<h3>Nodes Currency</h3>

<p>Nodes are CGraph's universal currency. Users earn Nodes through engagement and can spend them on premium interactions. The system is backed by Stripe for real-money purchases and payouts, with the backend handling all ledger operations through Ecto transactions.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Paid DM to a creator</td><td>Variable (set by creator)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Premium thread access</td><td>Variable (set by creator)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tip a post</td><td>Any amount</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Revenue Sharing</h3>

<p>Creators receive a share of Node transactions on their content. Paid DMs, premium thread access, and tips flow directly to the creator's balance. Payouts are processed through Stripe Connect, giving creators a real revenue stream from their community contributions.</p>

<h3>Paid DMs</h3>

<p>Creators can set a Node cost for direct messages from non-followers. This solves the spam problem without blocking legitimate outreach — if someone is willing to pay for your attention, the message is likely worth reading. Creators keep the majority of the Node payment.</p>

<h3>Premium Threads</h3>

<p>Forum threads can be gated behind a Node payment. Creators share exclusive content, analysis, or resources, and interested community members pay to access. The creator economy gives forum participation a tangible value beyond traditional reputation systems.</p>

<h3>Integration with Cosmetics</h3>

<p>Nodes are also used to unlock certain cosmetic items — premium profile frames, exclusive name styles, and rare forum themes. This connects the creator economy with the cosmetics system: earn Nodes through quality content, spend them on self-expression.</p>

<p>Phase 35 built the Cosmetics Unlock Engine — the system that replaced gamification as CGraph's primary self-expression mechanism. 325 items across 7 categories, 7 rarity tiers from Common to Mythic, and 5 rule-based unlock evaluators.</p>

<h3>Item Categories</h3>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Count</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Badges</td><td>70</td><td>Profile badges shown next to username</td></tr>
<tr><td>Titles</td><td>70</td><td>Displayed below username (e.g., "Founding Member")</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nameplates</td><td>45</td><td>Background decoration for username area</td></tr>
<tr><td>Profile Themes</td><td>25</td><td>Full profile page color schemes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Name Styles</td><td>50</td><td>Font and color effects on displayed name</td></tr>
<tr><td>Profile Frames</td><td>55</td><td>Decorative borders around profile picture</td></tr>
<tr><td>Forum Themes</td><td>10</td><td>Custom styling for forum posts</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Rarity Tiers</h3>

<p>Every item has a rarity that determines its visual treatment and unlock difficulty:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Common</strong> — Available to everyone, basic visual treatments</li>
<li><strong>Uncommon</strong> — Slight activity requirements</li>
<li><strong>Rare</strong> — Moderate engagement milestones</li>
<li><strong>Epic</strong> — Significant community contribution</li>
<li><strong>Legendary</strong> — Exceptional commitment to the platform</li>
<li><strong>Mythic</strong> — Extraordinarily rare, often time-limited</li>
<li><strong>Free</strong> — Baseline cosmetic tier used for default or universally available items</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unlock Evaluators</h3>

<p>Five rule-based evaluators determine when a user earns a cosmetic item:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Achievement Evaluator</strong> — Triggered when a user completes an achievement (70 achievements total)</li>
<li><strong>Milestone Evaluator</strong> — Based on cumulative metrics (messages sent, posts created, reactions given)</li>
<li><strong>Subscription Evaluator</strong> — Premium-tier entitlements unlock exclusive cosmetics</li>
<li><strong>Purchase Evaluator</strong> — Items available through the Nodes currency system</li>
<li><strong>Source Evaluator</strong> — Some cosmetics are tied to source categories such as seasonal drops or platform milestones rather than rarity itself</li>
</ol>

<h3>Backend Architecture</h3>

<p>The cosmetics system is built as an Elixir context module with a manifest-driven approach. The <code>COSMETICS_MANIFEST.md</code> defines all 325 items with their category, rarity, unlock conditions, and visual metadata. The unlock engine evaluates conditions on relevant events (achievement earned, subscription changed, milestone reached) and grants items automatically.</p>

<p>Items are stored as user associations in PostgreSQL. Equipped items (active badge, title, nameplate, theme, name style, frame, forum theme) are tracked per-user with efficient ETS caching for frequently-accessed profiles.</p>

<p>Two complementary systems shipped in Phases 29 and 31: <strong>Secret Chat</strong> for maximum privacy and <strong>Discovery</strong> for finding the right communities and content. Privacy and discoverability coexisting in the same platform.</p>

<h3>Secret Chat (Phase 29)</h3>

<p>Secret Chat adds ephemeral messaging on top of CGraph's existing post-quantum E2EE. Messages in a secret chat have additional protections beyond standard encryption:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Disappearing Messages</strong> — Configurable timers (30 seconds to 7 days). Messages auto-delete from both sender and recipient devices after the timer expires.</li>
<li><strong>Screenshot Detection</strong> — The client detects screenshot attempts and notifies the sender. On mobile, the screen content is obscured in the app switcher.</li>
<li><strong>Forward Restriction</strong> — Messages cannot be forwarded, copied, or shared outside the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>No Server Storage</strong> — Secret chat messages are never persisted on the server beyond delivery.</li>
</ul>

<p>The backend handles secret chat through a dedicated Phoenix Channel (<code>secret:{conversation_id}</code>) with additional authorization checks. Message delivery is fire-and-forget — once both parties receive the ciphertext, the server discards it.</p>

<h3>Discovery System (Phase 31)</h3>

<p>The Discovery system makes CGraph's communities, users, and content findable without compromising privacy. Built on MeiliSearch with PostgreSQL ILIKE as an automatic fallback:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Community Discovery</strong> — Browse public servers by category, member count, and activity level</li>
<li><strong>User Discovery</strong> — Find users by username, display name, or shared communities</li>
<li><strong>Content Discovery</strong> — Search across public forum posts, threads, and comments</li>
<li><strong>Trending</strong> — Algorithmically surfaced communities and content based on recent activity</li>
</ul>

<p>Privacy is respected throughout: private conversations never appear in search results. Users can opt out of being discoverable entirely through their privacy settings (7 per-field visibility controls added in Phase 25).</p>

<h3>The Balance</h3>

<p>Secret Chat and Discovery represent two sides of CGraph's philosophy: you should be able to find people and communities easily, but your private conversations should be truly private. The same platform supports both use cases without compromise.</p>

    title: 'The Great Delete: Why We Removed All Gamification UI',

<p>Phase 26 was the most consequential decision in CGraph's development. We deleted every gamification UI element — XP bars, level badges, leaderboards, quests, battle pass, prestige system, skill trees, seasonal events, and the shop UI. Thousands of lines of frontend code, removed in a single phase. Here's why.</p>

<h3>What We Deleted</h3>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>System</th><th>What It Did</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>XP Bars & Levels</td><td>Numeric progression on every profile</td><td>Removed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leaderboards</td><td>Competitive rankings by XP earned</td><td>Removed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quests</td><td>Daily/weekly task lists for XP</td><td>Removed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Battle Pass</td><td>Seasonal progression track</td><td>Removed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prestige System</td><td>Reset XP for special badges</td><td>Removed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Skill Trees</td><td>Spec into communication styles</td><td>Removed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Seasonal Events</td><td>Time-limited XP challenges</td><td>Removed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shop UI</td><td>Buy items with earned currency</td><td>Removed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Achievements (backend)</td><td>70 milestones</td><td><strong>Kept</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>Cosmetics (backend)</td><td>325 items, 7 categories</td><td><strong>Kept</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>Titles (backend)</td><td>70 display titles</td><td><strong>Kept</strong></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Why Gamification Was Wrong</h3>

<p>The fundamental problem: <strong>gamification incentivizes quantity over quality</strong>. When every message earns XP, users send low-effort messages to grind. When leaderboards rank by XP, the most valuable community members aren't at the top — the grinders are. Quests and battle passes create obligation, not engagement.</p>

<p>We were building a messaging platform that accidentally encouraged spam. That's backwards.</p>

<h3>What Replaced It</h3>

<p>Four new systems replaced the gamification layer, each designed to reward quality over quantity:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pulse Reputation (Phase 30)</strong> — Organic trust signals based on community standing, not XP accumulation. Your reputation grows from others' endorsements, not from grinding tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Nodes Currency (Phase 32)</strong> — A creator economy currency that has real value. Earn Nodes through quality contributions, spend them on paid DMs, premium threads, and cosmetics.</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetics & Self-Expression (Phase 35)</strong> — 325 items across 7 categories. Unlock through achievements, milestones, subscriptions, purchases, and events — not by grinding XP.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery System (Phase 31)</strong> — Find communities and content through search and algorithmic surfacing, not through competitive leaderboards.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What We Intentionally Kept</h3>

<p>The backend systems were preserved because they serve real purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>70 Achievements</strong> — Milestones that mark genuine accomplishments (first post, 100 messages, 1-year membership). No XP reward — just the achievement itself and a cosmetic unlock.</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetics System</strong> — 325 items that let users express themselves. Badges, titles, nameplates, profile themes, name styles, profile frames, and forum themes.</li>
<li><strong>Pulse</strong> — Forum post voting (upvote/downvote) that surfaces quality content. This is Reddit-style content curation, not gamification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Technical Side</h3>

<p>The Great Delete was surgically precise. We removed all frontend gamification components while keeping the backend Elixir context modules (<code>gamification.ex</code>, achievements, titles, cosmetics) intact. The Zustand stores were cleaned up — gamification facades removed, cosmetics-specific stores created. Mobile followed the same pattern.</p>

<p>The architecture score actually went up after the delete (8.2 → 8.5) because we were removing complexity, not adding it. Less code, fewer bugs, clearer purpose.</p>

<h3>Lesson Learned</h3>

<p>If your engagement system can be gamed by spamming, it's not measuring engagement — it's measuring spam tolerance. Build systems that reward the behavior you actually want.</p>

<p>v0.9.26 shipped all the fixes from our architecture audit (scored 7.7/10). The result: <strong>9.2/10</strong>. 96 files changed, +1,952 / -2,996 lines. Net reduction of over 1,000 lines while making the codebase significantly easier to navigate.</p>

<h3>Phoenix Router Split</h3>

<p>The monolithic <code>router.ex</code> had grown to <strong>989 lines</strong> — every API route in a single file. We decomposed it into <strong>7 domain macro modules</strong> using Phoenix's <code>defmacro</code> pattern:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Module</th><th>Lines</th><th>Scope</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>health_routes.ex</td><td>38</td><td>Health checks, readiness probes</td></tr>
<tr><td>auth_routes.ex</td><td>90</td><td>Login, register, OAuth, tokens</td></tr>
<tr><td>public_routes.ex</td><td>71</td><td>Public API endpoints</td></tr>
<tr><td>user_routes.ex</td><td>257</td><td>User CRUD, profiles, settings</td></tr>
<tr><td>messaging_routes.ex</td><td>87</td><td>DMs, conversations, voice</td></tr>
<tr><td>forum_routes.ex</td><td>117</td><td>Forums, posts, comments, votes</td></tr>
<tr><td>gamification_routes.ex</td><td>124</td><td>Achievements, cosmetics, Pulse, Nodes</td></tr>
<tr><td>admin_routes.ex</td><td>135</td><td>Admin panel, moderation, metrics</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The main <code>router.ex</code> dropped from 989 to <strong>122 lines</strong> — containing only pipeline definitions and macro imports. Each domain module expands at compile time, so zero runtime overhead.</p>

<h3>Frontend Component Organization</h3>

<p>The web app's <code>components/</code> directory had <strong>28 files in a flat structure</strong>. We organized them into 6 categorized subdirectories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ui/</strong> — Button, Input, TextArea, Select, Modal, Tooltip</li>
<li><strong>feedback/</strong> — ErrorBoundary, Loading, Toast, ProgressBar, EmptyState</li>
<li><strong>media/</strong> — VoiceMessagePlayer, VoiceMessageRecorder, Waveform, FileUpload</li>
<li><strong>content/</strong> — MarkdownRenderer, MarkdownEditor, BBCodeRenderer, BBCodeEditor</li>
<li><strong>user/</strong> — Avatar, UserBadge</li>
<li><strong>navigation/</strong> — Tabs, Switch, Dropdown, TagInput, AnimatedLogo</li>
</ul>

<p>Each directory has a barrel <code>index.ts</code> for clean imports. The root barrel re-exports everything for backward compatibility — <strong>zero breaking changes</strong> for the 17 consumers importing through the barrel.</p>

<h3>Build & Tooling Hardening</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Turborepo remote caching</strong> — enabled in <code>turbo.json</code> for faster CI builds across the team</li>
<li><strong>Bundle size monitoring</strong> — 8 size-limit budgets (Web JS 500KB, CSS 100KB, Landing JS 200KB, core 50KB, utils 30KB, ui 80KB, shared-types 20KB) with <code>pnpm size:check</code> for CI gating</li>
<li><strong>TypeScript path aliases</strong> — all 12 <code>@cgraph/*</code> aliases now defined in both web and mobile tsconfigs</li>
<li><strong>Version alignment</strong> — all 16 packages synchronized to v0.9.26</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dead Code Removal</h3>

<p>Removed <strong>854 lines</strong> of deprecated circuit breaker code (two modules with zero callers) and cleaned up the orphaned <code>apps/apps/</code> directory. The active circuit breakers (<code>CGraph.CircuitBreaker</code>, <code>CGraph.HTTP.Middleware.CircuitBreaker</code>, <code>CGraph.Redis</code>) remain unchanged.</p>

<p>v0.9.25 was all about setting hard limits and sticking to them: <strong>every backend module under 500 lines</strong>, <strong>every React component under 300 lines</strong>. Both targets hit. Along the way I added 56 <code>@spec</code> type annotations, audited all 45 <code>Repo.delete</code> calls, and synced documentation across the project.</p>

<h3>Backend Module Splits</h3>

<p>Eight Elixir modules exceeded the 500-line threshold. Each was refactored using the <strong>sub-module + defdelegate pattern</strong>: business logic moves into focused sub-modules under the parent namespace, while the parent retains its public API via <code>defdelegate</code> calls.

<p>Total: <strong>4,992 lines refactored</strong> into 26 focused sub-modules averaging ~115 lines each.</p>

<tr><td>Sidebar</td><td>352 lines</td><td>195 lines</td><td>ChannelList, ServerHeader, useSidebarState</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Type Safety: 56 @spec Annotations</h3>

<p>We audited every public function across the 8 refactored modules and added <code>@spec</code> annotations to all 56 public-facing functions. Combined with Dialyzer, this gives us compile-time type checking on all module boundaries.</p>

<h3>Soft Delete Audit</h3>

<p>All 45 <code>Repo.delete</code> calls were reviewed against our soft delete policy. Messages, channels, and user-generated content use <code>deleted_at</code> timestamps for recoverability. Only ephemeral data (typing indicators, presence records, expired tokens) uses hard deletes — all documented and approved.</p>

<h3>Documentation Sync</h3>

<p>Every documentation file was audited and updated: broken file references fixed across 8 files, architecture scores updated (9.0 → 9.4/10), feature module counts corrected (51 → 59), version numbers synchronized across all 6 packages. The <code>CURRENT_STATE_DASHBOARD.md</code> now includes the full sub-module tree.</p>

<h3>Architecture Health Score: 9.4/10</h3>

<p>With Phase 11 complete, the project scores:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Backend</strong>: 0 / 63 modules over 500-line limit (was 8)</li>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: 0 / 47 components over 300-line limit (was 5)</li>
<li><strong>Type coverage</strong>: 56 new @spec annotations on refactored modules</li>
<li><strong>Soft delete compliance</strong>: 45/45 calls audited and documented</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: 100% file reference accuracy, versions synchronized</li>

<h3>Reanimated v4 Migration: 222 → 0 TypeScript Errors</h3>

<p>The hardest part was migrating from Reanimated v2/v3 to <strong>Reanimated v4</strong>. Upgrading broke 222 TypeScript errors instantly — basically every animated component needed a rewrite against the new shared value API.</p>

<p>Key changes in the Reanimated v4 migration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>useSharedValue</strong> type signatures became stricter — no more implicit <code>any</code> on animated values</li>
<li><strong>useAnimatedStyle</strong> now requires explicit return types matching the style object</li>
<li><strong>Layout animations</strong> were refactored to use the new <code>LinearTransition</code> and <code>FadingTransition</code> APIs</li>
<li><strong>Gesture handler</strong> integration was updated for Reanimated v4's worklet threading model</li>
</ul>

<p>The migration took two focused sprints. I wrote a codemod script (<code>scripts/codemod-springs.mjs</code>) that handled about 80% of the mechanical stuff — converting old spring configs, updating gesture handler calls. The rest needed manual work, especially the complex composed animations.</p>

<h3>Test Coverage: 1,342 Passing Tests</h3>

<p>Parity without tests is just hope. The suite now has <strong>1,342 passing tests</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>132 facade tests</strong> — ensuring every store facade (Auth, Chat, Achievements, Settings, Community, Creator Economy, UI) correctly composes from underlying stores</li>
<li><strong>192 E2EE tests</strong> — comprehensive Triple Ratchet test suite covering PQXDH key exchange, hybrid ratcheting, post-quantum forward secrecy, adversarial scenarios, and stress testing</li>
<li><strong>200+ component tests</strong> — rendering, interaction, and accessibility tests for shared UI components</li>
<li><strong>Platform-specific tests</strong> — mobile gesture handlers, navigation flows, and native module mocks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Architecture Score: 9.0/10</h3>

<p>The internal scoring system checks module boundaries, dependency direction, API surface, and test coverage. With parity done, we hit <strong>9.0/10</strong> — up from 4.2 a few weeks earlier. The remaining point comes from cleaning up some cross-module imports and adding integration tests for WebRTC.</p>

<h4>What’s Next</h4>

<p>Now that parity is done, focus shifts to performance. Profiling mobile startup with Flipper, targeting sub-2-second cold starts on mid-range Android. The shared animation constants package (<code>@cgraph/animation-constants</code>) keeps motion consistent across platforms without runtime cost.</p>

<p>v0.9.15 will be landing site polish and getting docs ready for public beta.</p>

<p>CGraph started the way most projects do: I added features wherever they fit, stores multiplied without anyone stopping them, and everything depended on everything else. Architecture score: <strong>4.2/10</strong>. Here’s how I took it to <strong>9.0</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Problem: Architectural Debt</h3>

<p>By late January 2026, the mess was hard to ignore:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>32 scattered Zustand stores</strong> with overlapping concerns — three different stores touched message state</li>
<li><strong>No clear module boundaries</strong> — a settings component imported directly from the chat store</li>
<li><strong>God components</strong> — <code>Settings.tsx</code> was 1,172 lines, <code>SocketManager.ts</code> was 960 lines</li>
<li><strong>Circular dependencies</strong> detected in 7 places by our build tooling</li>
<li><strong>No facade layer</strong> — every component reached directly into store internals</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Solution: 12 Feature Modules + 7 Facades</h3>

<p>I reorganized everything into a <strong>modular system</strong> — each domain owns its state, hooks, components, and types. 12 feature modules:</p>

<pre><code>src/
├── modules/
│   ├── auth/           # Authentication, session, OAuth
│   ├── chat/           # Messaging, channels, DMs, reactions
│   ├── community/      # Servers, roles, permissions, moderation
│   ├── e2ee/           # Triple Ratchet / PQXDH, key management
│   ├── forums/         # Threads, posts, nested comments
│   ├── achievements/   # Achievements, cosmetics, Pulse, Nodes
│   ├── creator-economy/ # Tipping, premium threads, Nodes
│   ├── media/          # Voice, video, screen sharing (WebRTC)
│   ├── notifications/  # Push, in-app, preferences
│   ├── profiles/       # User profiles, avatars, status
│   ├── search/         # Full-text search, filters
│   └── settings/       # App preferences, theme, privacy
├── facades/
│   ├── useAuth.ts
│   ├── useChat.ts
│   ├── useCommunity.ts
│   ├── useAchievements.ts
│   ├── useCreatorEconomy.ts
│   ├── useSettings.ts
│   └── useUI.ts
└── shared/
    └── ui/             # 90+ reusable components</code></pre>

<h3>The Facade Pattern</h3>

<p>The biggest win was adding <strong>7 facade hooks</strong> between components and stores. Instead of importing from three different stores, components just call <code>useChat()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// Before: Components reaching into multiple stores
const messages = useMessageStore(s =&gt; s.messages);
const channels = useChannelStore(s =&gt; s.channels);
const typing = usePresenceStore(s =&gt; s.typingUsers);
const sendMessage = useMessageStore(s =&gt; s.sendMessage);

// After: Single facade with clean API
const { messages, channels, typingUsers, sendMessage } = useChat();</code></pre>

<p>Why this matters:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong> — Store internals can change without affecting components</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> — Facades are testable units with 132 dedicated tests</li>
<li><strong>Discoverability</strong> — Developers know exactly which facade to use for each feature</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> — Facades use Zustand selectors to minimize re-renders</li>
</ul>

<h3>32 Stores → 7 Facades: The Consolidation</h3>

<p>The 32 original stores mapped to 7 facades as follows:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Facade</th><th>Stores Consolidated</th><th>Tests</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>useAuth</td><td>authStore, sessionStore, oauthStore, tokenStore</td><td>18</td></tr>
<tr><td>useChat</td><td>messageStore, channelStore, dmStore, reactionStore, presenceStore, threadStore</td><td>24</td></tr>
<tr><td>useAchievements</td><td>achievementStore, cosmeticsStore, pulseStore, nodesStore</td><td>16</td></tr>
<tr><td>useSettings</td><td>preferencesStore, themeStore, notificationSettingsStore, privacyStore</td><td>14</td></tr>
<tr><td>useCommunity</td><td>serverStore, roleStore, permissionStore, moderationStore, memberStore</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>useCreatorEconomy</td><td>tippingStore, premiumThreadStore, nodesStore, transactionStore</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>useUI</td><td>modalStore, sidebarStore, toastStore, layoutStore, navigationStore</td><td>28</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>90+ Shared UI Components</h3>

<p>Along the way I pulled out <strong>90+ reusable UI components</strong> into a shared layer — everything from <code>Button</code> and <code>Input</code> to <code>MessageBubble</code> and <code>ChannelList</code>. Same props interface on web and mobile.</p>

<h3>Measuring the Transformation</h3>

<p>Our architecture scoring evaluates five dimensions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Module Isolation</strong> (before: 3/10, after: 9/10) — Cross-module imports reduced by 94%</li>
<li><strong>API Surface</strong> (before: 4/10, after: 9/10) — Clean facade boundaries</li>
<li><strong>Test Coverage</strong> (before: 5/10, after: 9/10) — 132 facade tests + 200+ component tests</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Direction</strong> (before: 3/10, after: 9/10) — No circular dependencies</li>
<li><strong>Code Organization</strong> (before: 6/10, after: 9/10) — Consistent module structure</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall: <strong>4.2 → 9.0</strong>. Three focused sprints. The codebase went from "don’t touch that file" to actually pleasant to work in.</p>

<p>E2EE is the part of CGraph where bugs are unacceptable. The crypto uses the <strong>Triple Ratchet protocol</strong> — a post-quantum hybrid protocol based on Signal’s Revision 4 spec. I wrote <strong>192 tests</strong> across 14 files to make sure every layer actually works.</p>

<h3>The Cryptographic Stack</h3>

<p>CGraph's E2EE implementation relies on five core primitives:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Primitive</th><th>Algorithm</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Key Agreement</td><td>PQXDH (P-256 ECDH + ML-KEM-768)</td><td>Hybrid post-quantum key exchange</td></tr>
<tr><td>Symmetric Encryption</td><td>AES-256-GCM</td><td>Encrypt/decrypt message payloads</td></tr>
<tr><td>Signing</td><td>ECDSA P-256</td><td>Identity key signatures, prekey signatures</td></tr>
<tr><td>Key Derivation</td><td>HKDF-SHA256</td><td>Derive encryption keys from shared secrets</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>PQXDH Key Exchange Tests (8 Tests)</h3>

<p>PQXDH establishes a hybrid shared secret using P-256 ECDH + ML-KEM-768, without both parties needing to be online. The tests validate:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Identity key pair generation</strong> — ECDSA P-256 keys are generated with proper entropy</li>
<li><strong>Signed prekey generation</strong> — P-256 prekeys signed by the identity key</li>
<li><strong>One-time prekey bundles</strong> — Ephemeral keys consumed correctly (no reuse)</li>
<li><strong>Key agreement computation</strong> — All four DH operations (DH1-DH4) produce correct shared secrets</li>
<li><strong>Bundle serialization</strong> — Prekey bundles serialize/deserialize without data loss</li>
<li><strong>Invalid bundle rejection</strong> — Malformed or tampered bundles are rejected</li>
<li><strong>Missing one-time prekey fallback</strong> — Sessions still establish without OTPs (3-DH fallback)</li>
<li><strong>Cross-device key agreement</strong> — Same identity, different devices, correct session creation</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>// Example: PQXDH Key Agreement Test
describe('PQXDH Key Exchange', () =&gt; {
  it('should establish matching shared secrets', async () =&gt; {
    const alice = await generateIdentityKeyPair();
    const bob = await generateIdentityKeyPair();
    const bobBundle = await createPrekeyBundle(bob);

    const aliceSession = await initiatePQXDH(alice, bobBundle);
    const bobSession = await respondPQXDH(bob, aliceSession.ephemeralKey);

    expect(aliceSession.sharedSecret).toEqual(bobSession.sharedSecret);
    expect(aliceSession.sharedSecret.length).toBe(32);
  });
});</code></pre>

<h3>Triple Ratchet Tests (10 Tests)</h3>

<p>The Triple Ratchet combines an EC Double Ratchet with a post-quantum SPQR ratchet. Each message gets a unique key derived from the hybrid state. Tests cover:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Symmetric ratchet step</strong> — Each message advances the chain key and derives a unique message key</li>
<li><strong>DH ratchet step</strong> — New DH key pairs are introduced when message direction changes</li>
<li><strong>Out-of-order message decryption</strong> — Messages received out of order decrypt correctly</li>
<li><strong>Skipped message keys</strong> — Keys for skipped messages are cached (up to configurable limit)</li>
<li><strong>Forward secrecy verification</strong> — Compromised current keys cannot decrypt past messages</li>
<li><strong>Break-in recovery</strong> — After key compromise, new DH ratchet restores security</li>
<li><strong>Chain length limits</strong> — Ratchet doesn't degrade over 1,000+ message chains</li>
<li><strong>Concurrent ratcheting</strong> — Two parties ratcheting simultaneously converge correctly</li>
<li><strong>Session state serialization</strong> — Ratchet state persists across app restarts</li>
<li><strong>Maximum skip threshold</strong> — Excessive message gaps are rejected to prevent DoS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ciphertext Integrity Tests (6 Tests)</h3>

<p>These tests ensure that the encryption layer is airtight:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ciphertext randomization</strong> — Same plaintext encrypted twice produces different ciphertext (AES-GCM nonce uniqueness)</li>
<li><strong>Tampered ciphertext rejection</strong> — Flipping even a single bit in the ciphertext causes GCM authentication to fail</li>
<li><strong>Tampered nonce rejection</strong> — Modified nonces are detected and rejected</li>
<li><strong>Truncated ciphertext rejection</strong> — Incomplete ciphertext is rejected before decryption attempt</li>
<li><strong>Header integrity</strong> — Message headers (ratchet public key, chain index, previous chain length) are authenticated</li>
<li><strong>Replay attack prevention</strong> — Already-consumed message keys cannot be reused</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>// Example: Ciphertext Randomization Test
it('should produce different ciphertext for identical plaintext', async () =&gt; {
  const session = await createTestSession();
  const plaintext = 'Hello, this is a test message';

  const cipher1 = await encrypt(session, plaintext);
  const cipher2 = await encrypt(session, plaintext);

  expect(cipher1.body).not.toEqual(cipher2.body);
  expect(await decrypt(session, cipher1)).toBe(plaintext);
  expect(await decrypt(session, cipher2)).toBe(plaintext);
});</code></pre>

<h3>Integration Tests (4 Tests)</h3>

<p>End-to-end scenarios that test the full flow from key exchange through multi-message conversations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full conversation flow</strong> — Alice and Bob exchange 50 messages with interleaved sends</li>
<li><strong>Group encryption fan-out</strong> — Message encrypted for each group member's session individually</li>
<li><strong>Device trust verification</strong> — Safety number comparison between two parties</li>
<li><strong>Key rotation on identity change</strong> — New identity keys invalidate existing sessions with proper warning</li>
</ul>

<h4>Running the Suite</h4>

<p>The suite runs with deterministic random seeds so results are reproducible. All 28 tests finish in under 3 seconds on CI, no network needed — everything runs in-process via <code>@cgraph/crypto</code>.</p>

<p>CGraph had 32 Zustand stores. Each one made sense when I created it, but together they were a nightmare — components importing from 3-4 stores, naming collisions, re-render hell. I consolidated them into <strong>7 facade hooks</strong>. Here’s how.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>With 32 stores, a single chat message component imported from 4 stores. That’s bad. The problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Import overhead</strong> — A single chat message component imported from <code>useMessageStore</code>, <code>usePresenceStore</code>, <code>useReactionStore</code>, and <code>useUserStore</code></li>
<li><strong>State synchronization</strong> — Related state lived in different stores with no coordination layer</li>
<li><strong>Testing burden</strong> — Mocking 4 stores for every component test was tedious and fragile</li>
<li><strong>Naming collisions</strong> — Multiple stores exported similarly named selectors (<code>getById</code>, <code>setLoading</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Re-render cascades</strong> — Without careful selector use, subscribing to multiple stores caused unnecessary re-renders</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Facade Pattern in Practice</h3>

<p>A facade wraps multiple stores behind one hook. Each facade composes from its underlying stores with shallow equality selectors to avoid re-renders:</p>

<pre><code>// facades/useChat.ts
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/react/shallow';
import { useMessageStore } from '../modules/chat/stores/messageStore';
import { useChannelStore } from '../modules/chat/stores/channelStore';
import { usePresenceStore } from '../modules/chat/stores/presenceStore';
import { useReactionStore } from '../modules/chat/stores/reactionStore';

export function useChat() {
  const messages = useMessageStore(useShallow(s =&gt; ({
    list: s.messages,
    send: s.sendMessage,
    edit: s.editMessage,
    delete: s.deleteMessage,
    loading: s.isLoading,
  })));

  const channels = useChannelStore(useShallow(s =&gt; ({
    list: s.channels,
    active: s.activeChannel,
    setActive: s.setActiveChannel,
  })));

  const presence = usePresenceStore(useShallow(s =&gt; ({
    typingUsers: s.typingUsers,
    onlineUsers: s.onlineUsers,
  })));

  const reactions = useReactionStore(useShallow(s =&gt; ({
    forMessage: s.getReactionsForMessage,
    add: s.addReaction,
    remove: s.removeReaction,
  })));

  return { messages, channels, presence, reactions };
}</code></pre>

<h3>The Seven Facades</h3>

<h4>1. useAuth — Authentication &amp; Session</h4>
<p>Composes <code>authStore</code>, <code>sessionStore</code>, <code>oauthStore</code>, and <code>tokenStore</code>. Exposes login, logout, token refresh, OAuth flows, and session state. 18 tests validate authentication flows including token expiration, refresh races, and OAuth callback handling.</p>

<h4>2. useChat — Messaging &amp; Channels</h4>
<p>The largest facade, composing 6 stores. Handles messages, channels, DMs, reactions, presence, and threading. 24 tests cover message CRUD, optimistic updates, real-time sync, and reaction toggling.</p>

<h4>3. useAchievements — Achievements &amp; Cosmetics</h4>
<p>Composes <code>achievementStore</code>, <code>cosmeticsStore</code>, <code>pulseStore</code>, and <code>nodesStore</code>. Exposes achievement tracking, cosmetics equipping, Pulse reputation queries, and Nodes balance management. 16 tests verify unlock triggers and cosmetics state.</p>

<h4>4. useSettings — Preferences &amp; Privacy</h4>
<p>Composes <code>preferencesStore</code>, <code>themeStore</code>, <code>notificationSettingsStore</code>, and <code>privacyStore</code>. Manages all user preferences with persistence. 14 tests validate theme switching, notification preferences, and privacy setting enforcement.</p>

<h4>5. useCommunity — Servers &amp; Moderation</h4>
<p>Composes 5 stores for server management, roles, permissions, moderation actions, and member lists. 20 tests cover role-based access control, permission inheritance, and moderation workflows.</p>

<h4>6. useCreatorEconomy — Tipping &amp; Nodes</h4>
<p>Composes <code>tippingStore</code>, <code>premiumThreadStore</code>, <code>nodesStore</code>, and <code>transactionStore</code>. Handles the creator economy with tipping, premium threads, Nodes balance, and transaction history. 12 tests validate transaction integrity and Nodes balance updates.</p>

<h4>7. useUI — Interface State</h4>
<p>Composes <code>modalStore</code>, <code>sidebarStore</code>, <code>toastStore</code>, <code>layoutStore</code>, and <code>navigationStore</code>. Manages all ephemeral UI state — modals, sidebars, toasts, and layout preferences. 28 tests ensure UI state transitions are predictable.</p>

<h3>Testing the Facades</h3>

<p>Each facade has dedicated tests using <code>@testing-library/react-hooks</code>. The 25 facade-specific tests (plus per-facade unit tests totaling 132) ensure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Facades expose the correct API surface</li>
<li>State changes in underlying stores propagate through the facade</li>
<li>Selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders (tested with render counters)</li>
<li>Error states from any composed store surface correctly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Import complexity dropped <strong>73%</strong>, test setup boilerplate dropped <strong>60%</strong>, naming collisions gone. The real win: you don’t need to know which of 32 stores has the data you want. Pick the right facade, done.</p>

<p>I let technical debt pile up. 325 <code>console.log</code> statements, 27 <code>as any</code> casts, a 1,172-line Settings component. Two of those logs were printing decrypted message content. Time to clean house.</p>

<h3>The Numbers</h3>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Reduction</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>console.log calls</td><td>325</td><td>2</td><td>99.4%</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>as any</code> type casts</td><td>27</td><td>1</td><td>96.3%</td></tr>

<tr><td>SocketManager.ts lines</td><td>960</td><td>616</td><td>35.8%</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>console.log: 325 → 2</h3>

<p>325 <code>console.log</code> calls everywhere. Most were leftover debugging — logging message payloads, WebSocket events, API responses. But it wasn’t just noise: two logs printed decrypted messages and one logged OAuth tokens. Security problem.</p>

<p>Replaced everything with a <strong>structured logging system</strong> with correlation IDs:</p>

<pre><code>// Before: Scattered console.log calls
console.log('Message sent:', message);
console.log('WebSocket connected');
console.log('Auth token refreshed:', token);

// After: Structured logging with correlation IDs
import { logger } from '@cgraph/utils/logger';

logger.info('message.sent', {
  correlationId: ctx.correlationId,
  channelId: message.channelId,
  encrypted: true,
});

logger.debug('websocket.connected', {
  correlationId: ctx.correlationId,
  endpoint: config.wsEndpoint,
});

logger.info('auth.token_refreshed', {
  correlationId: ctx.correlationId,
  expiresIn: token.expiresIn,
});</code></pre>

<p>JSON output in production, log levels, and it <strong>never</strong> logs sensitive data. Added a custom ESLint rule to block <code>console.log</code> from being committed.</p>

<p>The 2 remaining calls are in third-party shims where the library expects a console-compatible interface.</p>

<h3>as any: 27 → 1</h3>

<p>Every <code>as any</code> hides a bug. The 27 instances broke down into three buckets:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Event handler mismatches</strong> (12 instances) — Fixed by adding proper event type generics</li>
<li><strong>Third-party library types</strong> (9 instances) — Fixed by adding <code>@types</code> packages or writing declaration files</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic data from API</strong> (6 instances) — Fixed by adding Zod schema validation at API boundaries</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>// Before: as any to silence TypeScript
const data = response.data as any;
handleMessage(data.content);

// After: Zod schema validation
import { messageSchema } from '@cgraph/shared-types';
const result = messageSchema.safeParse(response.data);
if (result.success) {
  handleMessage(result.data.content);
} else {
  logger.warn('message.parse_failed', { errors: result.error.issues });
}</code></pre>

<p>The last <code>as any</code> is in a WebRTC adapter where Chrome and Firefox intentionally disagree on types.</p>

<h3>Settings.tsx: 1,172 → 221 Lines</h3>

<p><code>Settings.tsx</code> was a god-component. Every settings panel inline, one massive switch statement with 1,172 lines. I split it into a route-based module:</p>

<pre><code>settings/
├── SettingsLayout.tsx       # Shell with sidebar navigation (221 lines)
├── panels/
│   ├── AppearancePanel.tsx  # Theme, colors, font size
│   ├── NotificationPanel.tsx # Push, email, in-app preferences
│   ├── PrivacyPanel.tsx     # Visibility, blocking, data controls
│   ├── AccountPanel.tsx     # Email, password, 2FA, delete account
│   ├── SecurityPanel.tsx    # Active sessions, E2EE keys
│   └── AccessibilityPanel.tsx # Reduced motion, screen reader
└── hooks/
    └── useSettingsNavigation.ts</code></pre>

<p>Each panel is self-contained and lazy-loaded. <code>SettingsLayout.tsx</code> is now 221 lines — just the sidebar nav.</p>

<h3>SocketManager: 960 → 616 Lines (5 Modules)</h3>

<p>The original <code>SocketManager.ts</code> did everything: connections, reconnection, subscriptions, presence, routing. 960 lines. I split it into 5 modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ConnectionManager.ts</strong> — WebSocket connection, heartbeat, reconnection with exponential backoff</li>
<li><strong>ChannelManager.ts</strong> — Phoenix Channel joins, leaves, and topic management</li>
<li><strong>PresenceManager.ts</strong> — Phoenix Presence syncing and diff handling</li>
<li><strong>MessageRouter.ts</strong> — Incoming message dispatch to appropriate stores</li>
<li><strong>SocketManager.ts</strong> — Orchestrator that composes the above services (616 lines, down from 960)</li>
</ul>

<p>The codemod script <code>scripts/codemod-structured-logging.mjs</code> automated the log migration. Component extractions were done manually with tests at each step.</p>

<h4>Enforcing the Standards</h4>

<p>To keep it clean: <code>no-console</code> ESLint rule (only <code>warn</code>/<code>error</code> allowed), <code>@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any</code> set to error, and a file-length rule (warn at 300, error at 500). All enforced in CI.</p>

<p>Most projects ship one app for everything — marketing, auth, product. Works fine until visitors downloading your pricing page also get megabytes of encryption libraries. CGraph splits them into two separate apps.</p>

<h3>The Two Applications</h3>

</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Why Separate?</h3>

<p>The decision was driven by three factors:</p>

<h4>1. Performance Budget</h4>
<p>The landing site targets a <strong>200KB total transfer budget</strong>. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and above-the-fold images. A sub-2-second Time to Interactive on a 3G connection is the bar. This is impossible if the landing page shares a bundle with the E2EE crypto library (which alone is ~180KB), the Zustand state layer, or the WebRTC stack.</p>

<h4>2. SEO and Crawlability</h4>
<p>Marketing pages need to be statically renderable and crawlable. The landing site uses Vite with server-side rendering hints and prerendered routes. The web app is a client-side SPA that requires authentication — it's invisible (and should be) to search engines.</p>

<h4>3. Deployment Independence</h4>
<p>The landing site deploys to Vercel with global edge caching and automatic preview deployments. The web app deploys to Fly.io (IAD) as a containerized application. They have independent CI pipelines, independent release cycles, and can be updated without affecting each other.</p>

<h3>The Monorepo Structure</h3>

<p>Both applications live in the same pnpm monorepo, sharing packages where appropriate:</p>

│   ├── landing/          # cgraph.org - Marketing site

<h3>62 Lazy-Loaded Pages</h3>

<p>The web app uses React's <code>lazy()</code> with Suspense for every route. Combined with Vite's chunk splitting, this means users only download the code for the page they're viewing:</p>

<pre><code>// Web app route definitions (simplified)
const ChatPage = lazy(() =&gt; import('./modules/chat/pages/ChatPage'));
const ForumPage = lazy(() =&gt; import('./modules/forums/pages/ForumPage'));
const MarketplacePage = lazy(() =&gt; import('./modules/marketplace/pages/MarketplacePage'));
const SettingsPage = lazy(() =&gt; import('./modules/settings/pages/SettingsLayout'));
// ... 62 total routes</code></pre>

<h3>168 Optimized Build Chunks</h3>

<p>Vite's Rollup-based build produces 168 chunks for the web app. We configured manual chunk splitting to optimize for common navigation patterns:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vendor chunks</strong> — React, Zustand, and framer-motion in a shared vendor chunk (cached across pages)</li>
<li><strong>Module chunks</strong> — Each feature module gets its own chunk group</li>
<li><strong>Crypto chunk</strong> — E2EE library isolated so it's only loaded when encryption is needed</li>
<li><strong>WebRTC chunk</strong> — Voice/video code loaded on-demand when a call starts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shared Packages</h3>

<p>Despite being separate apps, they share several packages through the monorepo:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>@cgraph/shared-types</strong> — TypeScript interfaces used by both frontend and the Elixir API client</li>
<li><strong>@cgraph/utils</strong> — Common utility functions shared across apps</li>
<li><strong>@cgraph/crypto</strong> — E2EE Triple Ratchet / PQXDH encryption library</li>
<li><strong>@cgraph/socket</strong> — WebSocket client for real-time communication</li>
<li><strong>@cgraph/animation-constants</strong> — Spring configs and duration values for consistent motion</li>
</ul>

<p>Two apps, same monorepo. The landing site stays under 200KB, and the full app gets all the room it needs for crypto, state management, and real-time features.</p>

    title: 'Critical Security Fixes: E2EE Plaintext Fallback',
    category: 'Security',
    author: 'Burca Lucas',

    content: `
<p>On January 25, 2026, during a security audit, I found a <strong>critical bug</strong>: under specific failure conditions, messages could silently fall back to unencrypted delivery without telling the sender. Here’s what happened, how I fixed it, and four other security issues I knocked out in the same sprint.</p>

<h3>CVE-Level: E2EE Plaintext Fallback</h3>

<h4>The Vulnerability</h4>
<p>When the Triple Ratchet session was in a bad state — failed key ratchet, deserialization error, whatever — the encryption layer threw an exception. The message-sending code caught it in a generic try/catch and just... sent the message as plaintext. No warning, no error in the UI. Sent successfully, “encrypted.” Except it wasn’t.</p>

<pre><code>// VULNERABLE CODE (removed)
try {
  const encrypted = await signalSession.encrypt(plaintext);
  await channel.push('message:send', { body: encrypted, encrypted: true });
} catch (error) {
  // BUG: Silent fallback to plaintext!
  await channel.push('message:send', { body: plaintext, encrypted: false });
}</code></pre>

<h4>The Impact</h4>
<p>An attacker who could trigger session corruption — tampered prekey bundles, message replay — could force plaintext delivery. The server would store unencrypted messages. E2EE guarantee: gone.</p>

<h4>The Fix</h4>
<p>Simple fix: <strong>never fall back to plaintext</strong>. If encryption fails, abort the send, show the user an error, and re-establish the session:</p>

<pre><code>// FIXED: Encryption failure aborts the send
try {
  const encrypted = await signalSession.encrypt(plaintext);
  await channel.push('message:send', { body: encrypted, encrypted: true });
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('e2ee.encrypt_failed', {
    correlationId: ctx.correlationId,
    errorType: error.constructor.name,
  });
  // Notify user and trigger session re-establishment
  throw new EncryptionFailedError(
    'Message could not be encrypted. Attempting to re-establish secure session.'
  );
}</code></pre>

<p>Also made the server <strong>reject any message marked <code>encrypted: false</code></strong> on E2EE channels. Belt and suspenders.</p>

<h3>Additional Security Fixes</h3>

<h4>1. Presence Privacy Leak</h4>
<p>The Phoenix Presence system was broadcasting online/offline status to all channel members, including users who had set their visibility to "invisible." The fix filters presence broadcasts through the user's privacy settings before emission:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Users who set "invisible" status were still visible to other members</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Server-side presence filtering in the Phoenix Channel join callback</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Stripe Webhook Misconfiguration</h4>
<p>The Stripe webhook endpoint was not verifying the <code>stripe-signature</code> header, allowing any HTTP client to forge subscription events. An attacker could have granted themselves premium features by sending a crafted <code>checkout.session.completed</code> event.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Subscription tier spoofing, revenue loss</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Added <code>Stripe.Webhook.constructEvent()</code> signature verification with the webhook signing secret</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. IP Spoofing via X-Forwarded-For</h4>
<p>The rate limiter was reading the client IP from the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header without validating the number of proxy hops. Behind our Cloudflare/fly.io proxy chain, clients could inject arbitrary IPs by adding extra entries to the header, bypassing rate limits entirely.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Rate limit bypass, potential brute-force amplification</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Configured trusted proxy count and only read the IP at the correct position in the forwarded chain</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. MIME Type Spoofing in File Uploads</h4>
<p>File uploads relied solely on the client-provided <code>Content-Type</code> header for MIME type validation. An attacker could upload an HTML file with an <code>image/png</code> Content-Type, which would pass validation but render as HTML when served, enabling stored XSS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Stored XSS through file upload</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Server-side magic byte validation using the file's actual binary content. Files are also served with <code>Content-Disposition: attachment</code> and strict <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> headers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Disclosure and Timeline</h4>
<p>All five fixed within 48 hours. No evidence of exploitation in logs. The plaintext fallback existed since the first E2EE implementation in v0.8.x and made it all the way to v0.9.12. Fixed in v0.9.13.</p>

<p>CGraph is a real-time messaging platform. The backend needs to hold millions of WebSocket connections, route messages in under 100ms, and survive deployments without dropping anyone. I looked at Node.js, Go, Rust, and Elixir. Went with <strong>Elixir 1.17+ and Phoenix 1.8</strong>.</p>

<h3>The BEAM VM: Built for Concurrency</h3>

<p>Elixir runs on the BEAM VM — originally built for Ericsson telephone switches in the 80s. Designed for systems that can’t go down and have to handle millions of connections. That’s exactly what a messaging platform needs.</p>

<p>Why this matters for CGraph:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lightweight processes</strong> — BEAM processes use ~2KB of memory each. We can spawn millions of them on a single server. Each WebSocket connection gets its own process.</li>
<li><strong>Preemptive scheduling</strong> — The BEAM's reduction-based scheduler ensures no single process can starve others. A slow message send doesn't block other users.</li>
<li><strong>Fault isolation</strong> — A crash in one process doesn't affect any other. A corrupted message parse doesn't take down the server.</li>
<li><strong>Hot code reloading</strong> — Code can be upgraded while the system is running. Zero-downtime deployments are a first-class feature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>OTP Supervision Trees</h3>

<p>OTP gives you patterns that have been running telecom infrastructure since before most developers were born. CGraph’s supervision tree:</p>

<pre><code>CGraph.Application (one_for_one)
├── CGraph.Repo (worker)
│   └── PostgreSQL connection pool
├── CGraph.Cache.Supervisor (rest_for_one)
│   ├── CGraph.Cache.ETS (worker)
│   ├── CGraph.Cache.Cachex (worker)
│   └── CGraph.Cache.Redis (worker)
├── CGraph.PubSub (worker)
│   └── Phoenix.PubSub with Redis adapter
├── CGraph.Endpoint (worker)
│   └── Phoenix HTTP + WebSocket endpoint
├── CGraph.Presence (worker)
│   └── Phoenix.Presence with CRDT state
└── CGraph.Workers.Supervisor (one_for_one)
    ├── CGraph.Workers.MessageProcessor (GenServer)
    ├── CGraph.Workers.NotificationDispatcher (GenServer)
    ├── CGraph.Workers.XPCalculator (GenServer)
    └── CGraph.Workers.AuditLogger (GenServer)</code></pre>

<p>The <code>one_for_one</code> strategy at the top level means if any major subsystem crashes, only that subsystem restarts — the rest of the application continues serving requests. The <code>rest_for_one</code> strategy on the cache supervisor ensures that if the ETS cache crashes, Cachex and Redis are also restarted to maintain consistency.</p>

<h3>PostgreSQL 16 with 94 Tables</h3>

<p>The data layer is <strong>PostgreSQL 16</strong> with Ecto. Schema has 94 tables:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Domain</th><th>Tables</th><th>Key Tables</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Users &amp; Auth</td><td>12</td><td>users, sessions, oauth_tokens, identity_keys</td></tr>
<tr><td>Messaging</td><td>18</td><td>messages, channels, channel_members, reactions, threads</td></tr>
<tr><td>Communities</td><td>14</td><td>servers, roles, permissions, invites, bans</td></tr>
<tr><td>E2EE</td><td>8</td><td>prekey_bundles, signed_prekeys, one_time_prekeys, sessions</td></tr>
<tr><td>Achievements & Cosmetics</td><td>11</td><td>achievements, cosmetics, pulse_scores, nodes_balances, titles</td></tr>
<tr><td>Creator Economy</td><td>9</td><td>tips, premium_threads, transactions, creator_payouts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Subscriptions</td><td>7</td><td>plans, subscriptions, invoices, payment_methods</td></tr>
<tr><td>Moderation</td><td>6</td><td>reports, audit_logs, content_filters, auto_mod_rules</td></tr>
<tr><td>System</td><td>6</td><td>settings, feature_flags, rate_limits, migrations</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>3-Tier Caching: ETS → Cachex → Redis</h3>

<p>Messaging needs aggressive caching. CGraph uses <strong>3 tiers</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tier 1: ETS (Erlang Term Storage)</strong> — In-process memory tables with sub-microsecond reads. Used for hot data: active channel memberships, online user sets, rate limit counters. ~50µs reads.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 2: Cachex</strong> — Elixir-native cache with TTL support, size limits, and cache-aside pattern. Used for frequently accessed but less volatile data: user profiles, server settings, permission matrices. ~200µs reads.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 3: Redis</strong> — Distributed cache for cross-node data sharing. Used for session tokens, presence state (across BEAM nodes), and pub/sub fanout. ~1ms reads.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reads cascade: ETS → Cachex → Redis → PostgreSQL. Writes invalidate all tiers. Sub-millisecond reads for 95% of requests.</p>

<h3>Phoenix Channels for WebSocket</h3>

<p>Phoenix Channels give you WebSocket with built-in features that would take months to build yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Topic-based routing</strong> — Users join channels like <code>"chat:channel_123"</code> or <code>"presence:server_456"</code></li>
<li><strong>Presence tracking</strong> — Built-in CRDT-based presence that syncs across BEAM nodes without conflicts</li>
<li><strong>Heartbeats</strong> — Automatic keep-alive with configurable timeouts</li>
<li><strong>Message buffering</strong> — Messages queued during brief disconnections are delivered on reconnect</li>
<li><strong>Transport fallback</strong> — Automatic fallback from WebSocket to long-polling for restrictive networks</li>
</ul>

<h3>GenServer-Based Workers</h3>

<p>Background work runs on <strong>GenServer</strong> modules — OTP’s generic server pattern. Each worker is supervised:</p>

<pre><code>defmodule CGraph.Workers.PulseCalculator do
  use GenServer

  @impl true
  def init(state) do
    schedule_batch_processing()
    {:ok, state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_cast({:update_pulse, user_id, action, metadata}, state) do
    delta = calculate_pulse_delta(action, metadata)
    {:ok, _} = Achievements.update_pulse(user_id, delta, action)
    check_cosmetic_unlocks(user_id)
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_info(:batch_process, state) do
    process_pending_pulse_events()
    schedule_batch_processing()
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>If a GenServer crashes — bad Pulse event, whatever — the supervisor restarts it in milliseconds. Pending work lives in PostgreSQL so nothing is lost. That’s the BEAM being the BEAM.</p>

<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>

<p>Elixir and Phoenix give CGraph a backend built for exactly this kind of app: lots of connections, real-time routing, fault tolerance, zero-downtime deploys. Not the trendiest choice, but the right one.</p>

<p>Your team uses one app for chat, another for forums, and separate tools for self-expression. CGraph puts all of it in one place — <strong>actually encrypted</strong>, with a cosmetics and achievement system that makes people want to participate.</p>

<h3>What CGraph Does</h3>

<h4>1. Real-Time Messaging</h4>
<p>CGraph's messaging is built for speed and reliability. Text channels, direct messages, group DMs, threads, reactions, file sharing, and rich embeds — all delivered over WebSocket with sub-100ms latency. Voice and video calls use WebRTC with adaptive bitrate for quality on any connection. Screen sharing works on both desktop and mobile.</p>

<p>The architecture behind this is Phoenix Channels on Elixir — a technology stack proven to handle millions of concurrent connections. Messages are routed through BEAM processes, each connection isolated, each failure contained.</p>

<h4>2. Community Forums</h4>
<p>Not everything belongs in real-time chat. Long-form discussions, knowledge bases, announcements, and Q&amp;A threads deserve a forum format. CGraph's forums support nested threading, upvotes/downvotes, rich text formatting with Markdown, and pinned posts. Each community server can have both chat channels and forum channels, switching between real-time and asynchronous discussion as needed.</p>

<p>Forums are fully searchable with PostgreSQL full-text search across titles, body content, and tags. Users can subscribe to threads for notifications without participating, and moderators have granular controls over thread visibility and permissions.</p>

<h4>3. Post-Quantum End-to-End Encryption</h4>
<p>Privacy isn’t a premium upsell — it’s the default. CGraph uses the <strong>Triple Ratchet protocol</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PQXDH key exchange</strong> — Hybrid key agreement combining P-256 ECDH + ML-KEM-768</li>
<li><strong>Triple Ratchet</strong> — EC Double Ratchet ∥ SPQR for forward secrecy and break-in recovery</li>
<li><strong>ML-KEM-768</strong> — Post-quantum key encapsulation for quantum resistance</li>
<li><strong>AES-256-GCM</strong> — Authenticated encryption for message payloads</li>
<li><strong>ECDSA P-256</strong> — Digital signatures for identity verification</li>
</ul>

<p>E2EE is on by default for DMs and available for group channels. The server stores encrypted blobs — we can’t read your messages. Safety numbers let you verify identities, and key changes show a visible warning.</p>

<h4>4. Cosmetics & Self-Expression</h4>
<p>This is the part that keeps people coming back. CGraph gives users 325 collectible items to express themselves:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Badges</strong> — 70 badges across categories earned through participation and achievements</li>
<li><strong>Titles</strong> — 70 titles with 7 rarity tiers from Common to Mythic, displayed next to your name</li>
<li><strong>Nameplates</strong> — 45 custom nameplates for profile personalization</li>
<li><strong>Profile Themes</strong> — 25 themes that transform your entire profile appearance</li>
<li><strong>Name Styles</strong> — 50 name color and animation styles</li>
<li><strong>Profile Frames</strong> — 55 animated frames around your avatar</li>
<li><strong>Forum Themes</strong> — 10 themes for customizing your forum experience</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creator Economy</h3>

<p>CGraph includes a creator economy powered by the Nodes currency system:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Paid DMs</strong> — Creators can charge for direct messages, setting their own rates</li>
<li><strong>Premium Threads</strong> — Gate forum threads with subscription requirements</li>
<li><strong>Tipping</strong> — Send Nodes to creators for content you appreciate</li>
<li><strong>Content Boosts</strong> — Promote your posts and profile to reach more people</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Sharing</strong> — Earn from your contributions to the platform</li>
</ul>

<p>Users earn Nodes through participation and can spend them across the platform. The creator economy is designed to reward quality content, not just volume.</p>

<h3>Subscription Tiers</h3>

<p>CGraph offers three subscription tiers designed to scale from individual users to enterprise deployments. Pricing will be finalized at public launch — here's what each tier includes:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Tier</th><th>Price</th><th>Key Features</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Free</td><td>Free forever</td><td>Full messaging, E2EE, forums, 70 achievements, 1 forum, 100MB storage</td></tr>
<tr><td>Premium</td><td>$9.99/mo</td><td>Full cosmetics collection, creator economy tools, HD/4K video, priority support, API access</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enterprise</td><td>Custom</td><td>Dedicated support, SLA, audit logs, admin dashboard, priority API access, custom branding</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Every tier includes E2EE — encryption is not a premium feature. The free tier is designed for personal communities, while Enterprise adds the administrative and compliance tools organizations need.</p>

<h3>Built for Communities</h3>

<p>CGraph is built for <strong>communities</strong> — gaming guilds, study groups, company teams, and project collaborators. The stack (Elixir/Phoenix, React/React Native, Triple Ratchet, PostgreSQL with 94 tables) is designed to handle everything from a 10-person group to 100k members without rearchitecting.</p>

<h4>Join the Beta</h4>

<p>CGraph is in closed beta, public launch planned for mid-2026. I’m building in public — every engineering decision is in this blog, every architecture change in the changelog. If you want a community platform that respects privacy and rewards participation, come check it out.</p>
